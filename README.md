## üöÄ Features

### Core Functionality
*   **Multiple Organization Modes:**
    *   **By Type:** Groups files into folders like `Images`, `Videos`, `Documents`.
    *   **By Name:** Creates a dedicated folder for each file.
    *   **By Date:** Sorts files into `Year/Month` folders.
    *   **By Size:** Categorizes files as `Small`, `Medium`, or `Large`.
    *   **By First Letter:** Groups files into alphabetical folders (`A`, `B`, `C`...).
*   **Flexible Actions:** Choose to **Move** original files or create a **Copy**.
*   **Smart Conflict Resolution:** Automatically `Rename`, `Overwrite`, or `Skip` files if they already exist in the destination.
*   **Recursive Processing:** Option to include all files from subdirectories in the organization process.

### User Experience & Interface
*   **Modern GUI:** Clean and intuitive interface built with PySide6.
*   **Real-time Progress:** A progress bar shows the status of organizing and undoing operations, ensuring the app never freezes.
*   **Detailed Results Table:** See the status of each file (Success, Skipped, Failed) in a clear, color-coded table.
*   **Multi-language Support:** Switch between **English** and **Arabic** on the fly.
*   **Themes:** Instantly switch between **Light** and **Dark** modes.
*   **Drag & Drop:** Easily drop your source folder into the path input field.

### Safety & Customization
*   **Undo Last Operation:** A critical safety feature! Revert the entire last organization process with a single click.
*   **Dry-run Mode:** A simulation mode that creates the target folder structure **without touching your files**, allowing you to preview the result safely.
*   **Profiles:** Save and load your favorite settings (e.g., "Sort Downloads" vs. "Backup Photos") for quick reuse.
*   **Editable Categories:** Full control to add, remove, or rename categories and their associated file extensions directly through the `categories.json` file.
