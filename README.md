# üìÇ Sortify - Advanced File Organizer

A powerful and user-friendly desktop application built with Python and PySide6 to intelligently sort your files into clean, organized folders.

Tired of cluttered "Downloads" or "Desktop" folders? Sortify automates the cleaning process with a rich set of features, a multi-language interface, and robust safety mechanisms like Undo and Dry-run mode.

## üöÄ Features

### Core Functionality

- **Multiple Organization Modes:**
    
    - **By Type:** Groups files into folders like `Images`, `Videos`, `Documents`.
        
    - **By Name:** Creates a dedicated folder for each file.
        
    - **By Date:** Sorts files into `Year/Month` folders (e.g., `2025/10-October`).
        
    - **By Day:** Sorts files into `Year/Month/Day` folders (e.g., `2025/10/16`).
        
    - **By Size:** Categorizes files as `Small`, `Medium`, or `Large`.
        
    - **By First Letter:** Groups files into alphabetical folders (`A`, `B`, `C`...).
        
- **Flexible Actions:** Choose to **Move** original files or create a **Copy**.
    
- **Smart Conflict Resolution:** Automatically `Rename`, `Overwrite`, or `Skip` files if they already exist in the destination.
    
- **Recursive Processing:** Option to include all files from subdirectories in the organization process.
    

### User Experience & Interface

- **Modern GUI:** Clean and intuitive interface built with PySide6.
    
- **Easy Windows Launch:** Includes a `Sortify.bat` script for double-click execution.
    
- **Real-time Progress:** A progress bar shows the status of organizing and undoing operations, ensuring the app never freezes.
    
- **Detailed Results Table:** See the status of each file (Success, Skipped, Failed) in a clear, color-coded table.
    
- **Multi-language Support:** Switch between **English** and **Arabic** on the fly.
    
- **Themes:** Instantly switch between **Light** and **Dark** modes.
    
- **Drag & Drop:** Easily drop your source folder into the path input field.
    

### Safety & Customization

- **Undo Last Operation:** A critical safety feature! Revert the entire last organization process with a single click.
    
- **Dry-run Mode:** A simulation mode that creates the target folder structure **without touching your files**, allowing you to preview the result safely.
    
- **Profiles:** Save and load your favorite settings (e.g., "Sort Downloads" vs. "Backup Photos") for quick reuse.
    
- **Editable Categories:** Full control to add, remove, or rename categories and their associated file extensions **directly from the app's interface**.

    Bash
    
    ```
    cd File-Organizer_v2
    ```
    
2. Make sure you have a compatible Python version installed (Python 3.12 is recommended for best library compatibility).
    
3. Install the required libraries using pip:
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

You can run the application in two ways:

1. **From the terminal (all platforms):**
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    python file_organizer_gui.py
    ```
    
2. On Windows (easy method):
    
    Simply double-click the Sortify.bat file.
    

**How it works:**

1. **Select Source & Destination:** Use the "Browse" buttons or drag-and-drop a folder into the "Source Folder" field. If the destination is left empty, a folder named `Organized_Files` will be created inside the source.
    
2. **Choose Your Options:** Select the organization mode, action (move/copy), and conflict policy from the dropdowns.
    
3. **Run:** Click the "Run" button to start the process.
    
4. **Monitor:** Watch the progress bar and view live logs or results in the tabbed view.
    
5. **Undo (if needed):** If you're not happy with the result, simply click the "Undo" button.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization

You have full control over the file categories. You can:

1. **Use the GUI:** Click the **"Manage Categories"** button in the app to visually add, rename, or remove categories and their associated file extensions.
    
2. **Edit Manually:** You can also directly edit the **`categories.json`** file. For example, to add `.eps` files to the "Images" category, simply add it to the list:
    

JSON

```
{
  "Images": [".jpg", ".jpeg", ".png", ".gif", ".bmp", ".tiff", ".webp", ".heic", ".eps"],
  "Videos": [...]
}
```
